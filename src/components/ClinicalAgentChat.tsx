    answer: "Warfarin has numerous significant drug interactions. NSAIDs, antiplatelet agents, and other anticoagulants increase bleeding risk. Many antibiotics (particularly macrolides, fluoroquinolones, metronidazole) potentiate warfarin effects by altering gut flora or inhibiting metabolism. Antiepileptics, rifampin, and barbiturates can decrease effectiveness through enzyme induction. SSRIs and SNRIs increase bleeding risk. Foods high in vitamin K antagonize warfarin. Regular INR monitoring is critical when starting or stopping any medication in patients on warfarin.",

  "What are the known side effects of apixaban, particularly in elderly patients or those with kidney impairment?": {
    answer: "The primary side effect of apixaban is bleeding, which is increased in elderly patients and those with renal impairment. Major bleeding occurs in approximately 2-3% of patients annually. Elderly patients have higher bleeding risk due to age-related changes in pharmacokinetics, frailty, falls risk, and polypharmacy. In renal impairment, dose adjustment is required when CrCl is 15-29 mL/min (2.5mg BID). Other side effects include nausea, rash, and elevated liver enzymes. Unlike warfarin, there's no routine monitoring, which can mask accumulation and bleeding risk in vulnerable patients.",

  "What's the recommended workup for unexplained weight loss?": {
    answer: "The workup for unexplained weight loss (typically defined as >5% of body weight in 6-12 months) should begin with a thorough history and physical examination, focusing on red flags for malignancy, GI disorders, psychological issues, and medication effects. Initial laboratory testing should include CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, TSH, HbA1c, ESR/CRP, and urinalysis. Age-appropriate cancer screening should be up to date. Additional focused testing may include chest X-ray, abdominal imaging, HIV testing, and stool studies. If initial evaluation is unrevealing, consider specialized testing based on specific symptoms or CT chest/abdomen/pelvis if malignancy is suspected.",

  "Are there any significant interactions between metoprolol and SSRIs?": {
    answer: "Yes, there are significant interactions between metoprolol and some SSRIs. Fluoxetine, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine are potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, the enzyme primarily responsible for metoprolol metabolism. This interaction can increase metoprolol blood levels by 2-5 fold, potentially causing bradycardia, hypotension, and AV block. Sertraline has a weaker effect, while citalopram and escitalopram have minimal impact on CYP2D6. For patients requiring both drugs, consider using SSRIs with minimal CYP2D6 inhibition, monitoring for metoprolol adverse effects, or dose reduction of metoprolol.",

  "Can amiodarone be safely combined with simvastatin?": {
    answer: "The combination of amiodarone and simvastatin carries significant risk and requires caution. Amiodarone inhibits CYP3A4, which metabolizes simvastatin, potentially increasing simvastatin plasma concentrations by 2-3 fold. This significantly increases the risk of myopathy and potentially life-threatening rhabdomyolysis. Current recommendations limit simvastatin dosing to a maximum of 20mg daily when combined with amiodarone. Alternative strategies include using statins less dependent on CYP3A4 metabolism (rosuvastatin, pravastatin) or switching to a different antiarrhythmic when appropriate.",

  "What are the guidelines for anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation?": {

For patients with AF and a CHAâ‚‚DSâ‚‚-VASc score â‰¥2 in men or â‰¥3 in women, anticoagulation is strongly recommended (Class I). For men with a score of 1 or women with a score of 2, anticoagulation should be considered (Class IIa). DOACs are preferred over warfarin for eligible patients with non-valvular AF (Class I). Anticoagulation is contraindicated in patients with high bleeding risk. Aspirin monotherapy is no longer recommended for stroke prevention.

  "How should I interpret elevated troponin levels?": {
    answer: "Elevated troponin indicates myocardial injury but is not specific to acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Interpretation requires clinical context. In suspected ACS, a rising/falling pattern with at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit is diagnostic of acute MI when accompanied by ischemic symptoms, ECG changes, or imaging evidence. Other causes include myocarditis, pulmonary embolism, heart failure, sepsis, renal failure, stroke, and strenuous exercise. The degree of elevation and dynamic changes help differentiate causes. High-sensitivity troponin assays detect more subtle injury but have lower specificity, requiring serial measurements and assessment of absolute/relative changes.",

  "What are the first-line medications for type 2 diabetes?": {
    answer: "According to the ADA 2024 Standards of Care, metformin remains the preferred initial medication for most patients with type 2 diabetes due to its efficacy, safety, and cost. However, for patients with established ASCVD, heart failure, CKD, or multiple cardiovascular risk factors, either a GLP-1 receptor agonist or SGLT2 inhibitor with proven cardiovascular benefit is recommended regardless of A1C or metformin use. In patients with heart failure or CKD, an SGLT2 inhibitor is particularly beneficial. Combination therapy may be considered at diagnosis for patients with A1C >1.5% above target. Cost, side effects, comorbidities, and patient preferences should guide medication selection.",

  "What are the A1C targets for different patient populations?": {
    answer: "A1C targets should be individualized based on patient factors. The general target is <7.0% for most adults with diabetes according to ADA guidelines. A more stringent target of <6.5% may be appropriate for selected patients (younger, early disease, no significant CVD, if achievable without hypoglycemia). Less stringent targets of <8.0% are reasonable for patients with limited life expectancy, advanced complications, extensive comorbidities, history of severe hypoglycemia, or inability to safely achieve lower targets due to patient circumstances. For older adults, targets range from <7.0-7.5% for healthy older adults with few comorbidities to <8.0-8.5% for those with multiple conditions, cognitive impairment, or functional dependence. During pregnancy, targets are more stringent: <6.0-6.5%.",

  "How should metformin be dosed to minimize side effects?": {
    answer: "To minimize metformin's GI side effects, start with a low dose and gradually titrate upward. Begin with 500mg once daily with dinner for 1 week, then increase to 500mg twice daily (with breakfast and dinner) for 1 week, and finally to the target dose of 1000mg twice daily if needed and tolerated. Taking metformin with meals reduces GI symptoms. Extended-release formulations have fewer GI side effects and can be given once daily, making them a good option for patients experiencing side effects on immediate-release preparations. If side effects occur during dose escalation, reduce to the previously tolerated dose and attempt a slower titration. The maximum recommended dose is 2000mg daily, with little additional glycemic benefit and increased side effects above this dose.",

  "What foods significantly affect warfarin efficacy?": {
    answer: "Foods high in vitamin K can significantly decrease warfarin efficacy by antagonizing its anticoagulant effect. The most significant sources include dark green leafy vegetables (kale, spinach, collard greens, turnip greens), green tea, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cabbage, and avocados. Patients should maintain consistent vitamin K intake rather than avoiding these foods completely - sudden large changes in consumption can destabilize INR. Certain dietary supplements can also interact with warfarin, including ginseng, ginkgo biloba, garlic, and St. John's wort. Cranberry juice in large amounts may increase INR. Grapefruit juice can affect warfarin metabolism but the clinical significance is controversial. Alcohol in large amounts can affect warfarin metabolism and increase bleeding risk by multiple mechanisms, particularly in patients with liver disease.",

  "What monitoring is required for patients on ACE inhibitors?": {
    answer: "Patients on ACE inhibitors like lisinopril require monitoring of several parameters: (1) Renal function (creatinine, eGFR) and electrolytes (particularly potassium) before initiation, 1-2 weeks after starting or dose increases, and periodically thereafter (every 3-12 months based on baseline kidney function); (2) Blood pressure monitoring to assess efficacy and avoid hypotension, especially after initial doses; (3) Clinical assessment for angioedema, particularly within the first month of treatment; (4) Symptoms of hyperkalemia, especially in patients with risk factors (CKD, diabetes, concurrent potassium-sparing diuretics or potassium supplements); (5) Complete blood count in patients with pre-existing renal impairment or collagen vascular diseases to monitor for neutropenia; and (6) Pregnancy testing in women of childbearing age before initiation, with contraception counseling due to fetal toxicity risks.",
